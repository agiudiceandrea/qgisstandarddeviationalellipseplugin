name=Standard Deviational Ellipse
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=Create a standard deviational ellipse for a set of points
about=A standard deviational ellipse is produced according to the method presented by Robert Yuill (1971). The method does not correct for degrees of freedom. The method does not give a radius equal to the standard distance deviation for a random point distribution (to achieve this, the SDs should be multiplied by sqrt(2), as explained in the CrimeStat documentation).
      A polygon vector layer with the standard deviational ellipse is produced, containing the attributes: meanx, meany, majorangle, minorangle, majorsd and minorsd. Angles are counter-clockwise relative to the first axis.
      An attribute for weighting can be selected.
      There are no external library dependencies.
