# qgisstandarddeviationalellipseplugin
A QGIS plugin to create a standard deviational ellipse, according to
the method presented by Robert Yuill (1971).

The plugin works on point vector layers.
The user can choose to use only selected features, and can choose
an attribute for weighting.

A polygon vector layer with the standard deviational ellipse is
produced, containing the attributes: meanx, meany, majorangle,
minorangle, majorsd and minorsd.
